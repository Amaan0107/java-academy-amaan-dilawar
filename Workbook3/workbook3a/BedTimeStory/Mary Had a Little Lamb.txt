Mary Had a Little Lamb

Mary loved her little lamb more than anything in the world. Its fleece was as white as snow, and it followed her wherever she went.

One morning, Mary walked to school, and the lamb trotted right behind her. The other children laughed and clapped their hands when they saw it in the classroom.

The teacher smiled kindly but said, “Lambs should wait outside, Mary.” So the lamb waited by the schoolhouse door, bleating softly until class was over.

When Mary came out, she hugged her lamb tight. From that day on, everyone at school loved the gentle little lamb who always stayed by Mary’s side.
