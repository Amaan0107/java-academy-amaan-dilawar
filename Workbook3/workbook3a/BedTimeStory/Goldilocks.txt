Goldilocks and the Three Bears

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks who loved to explore. One day, she wandered deep into the forest and found a cozy cottage.

Curious, she knocked on the door. Nobody answered, so she quietly stepped inside. On the table were three bowls of porridge.

She tasted the first bowl — too hot! The second bowl — too cold! But the third bowl was just right, so she ate it all up.

Next, she found three chairs. The big one was too hard, the middle one too soft, but the smallest was just right — until it broke!

Feeling sleepy, Goldilocks found three beds. The big bed was too high, the middle one too lumpy, but the little bed was just right. She fell fast asleep.

When the three bears came home, they were very surprised! Goldilocks woke up, saw them, and ran all the way home — never to wander into the forest again.
