Hansel and Gretel

Once upon a time, a poor woodcutter lived with his two children, Hansel and Gretel. One night, their stepmother whispered that there was not enough food for them all. The next morning, she led the children deep into the forest and left them there.

Clever Hansel had dropped breadcrumbs to find their way home, but the birds had eaten them all. The children wandered until they found a house made of candy and gingerbread.

They were so hungry that they began to eat it! Suddenly, a kind-looking old woman came out and invited them inside. But she was really a wicked witch who wanted to keep them forever.

Hansel and Gretel worked together to trick the witch. Gretel pushed her into her own oven, and the children escaped. They found their way home to their father, who had missed them dearly.
